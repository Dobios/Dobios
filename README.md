- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a computer nerd from Switzerland who likes thinking about languages and how we can make them better.  
- ðŸ‘€ I like thinking about how and why people reason about things, and what mistakes can be avoided if we reasoned about these things differently. Basically I like designing tools that make it easier to describe complex things correctly and reliably.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email (adobis@ethz.ch) or on linked-in.  
- âœ¨ You can find my favorite stuff pinned on my profile ;).  
**********************************
#### For Software  
- Most of my work is usually working a compiler, building some automated testing thingy, or making a video-game.   
- I will sometimes dable in something completely unrelated, so always keep your eyes open for that ;).  
  
#### For Hardware  
- I like reasoning about hardware, not so much developing it.
- Most of my work here will be on the languages people use to express designs and not the designs themselves.
- I've been doing a lot of work on the verification parts of [CIRCT](https://github.com/llvm/circt)) lately.  
    
#### For Video-Games  
- **Godot** is great, lightweight, easy to use and FOSS.  

**************************************  
## Current Projects I'm Working on  
Here is a list of the different projects that I'm currently actively working on.  

#### Formal Verification of Hardware in the CIRCT Compiler 
  - Field: __Hardware Verification / Hardware Compilers__
  - Language: __C++ / MLIR / LLVM / FIRRTL / BTOR2 / SMTLib / SystemVerilog__
  - Description: Augmenting the CIRCT compiler framework to enable the use of formal verification constructs in higher level hardware construction languages.

#### SURE Sustainable Development Energy Tycoon  
  - Field: __Video Games__
  - Language: __C#__
  - Description: Game about managing the impacts of political policies and energy managment choices on the swiss energy grid and society.
