- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dobios
- 👀 I’m interested in contemporary programming language designs speifically tailored for verification, as well as computer graphics and video-game developement.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about monte carlo rendering systems, as well as current formal verification backends ([Viper](https://github.com/viperproject) is something that has caught my attention recently ;) ).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any free and open-source video game project :).
- 📫 You can reach me via email (andrew.dobis@alumni.epfl.ch) or on linked-in.  
- ✨ You can find the external repositories to which I am a major/main contributor pinned in my profile ;).
