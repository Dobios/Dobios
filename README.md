- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dobios
- 👀 I’m interested in contemporary programming language designs speifically tailored for verification, as well as computer graphics and video-game developement.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about monte carlo rendering systems, as well as current formal verification backends ([Viper](https://github.com/viperproject) is something that has caught my attention recently ;) ).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any free and open-source video game project :).
- 📫 You can reach me via email (andrew.dobis@alumni.epfl.ch) or on linked-in.  
- ✨ You can find the external repositories to which I am a major/main contributor pinned in my profile ;).  
**********************************
#### For Software  
- The main languages I work in are *Scala*, *C#*, *C++*, *C*, *Python*, (and *Java* but please don't ask me to do anything in that). 
- I am also capable of getting things done in *JS*, *Kotlin*, *Rust*.  
- For Parallel High Performance stuff, I can work with *CUDA*, *OpenMP*, *TBB*, *AVX vector intrinsics*, and *MPI*. 
  
#### For Hardware  
- I mostly work with *Chisel*, and *VHDL*.  
- I also have some experience with *SystemVerilog*, and *Verilog*, as well as *HLS*.  
    
#### For Video-Games  
- My favorite engine is *Godot*.  
- I have also worked with *Unity*, *Phaser*, and bare-bones OpenGL.
