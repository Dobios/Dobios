- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @Dobios
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in contemporary compiler designs as well as formal verification systems, really anything related to automated testing for both hardware and software, and also video-game developement.  
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about modern hardware compiler infrastructure (more specifically [CIRCT](https://github.com/llvm/circt)).
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm happy to collaborate on any free and open-source video game project :).
- üì´ You can reach me via email (andrew.dobis@alumni.epfl.ch) or on linked-in.  
- ‚ú® You can find the external repositories to which I am a major/main contributor pinned in my profile ;).  
**********************************
#### For Software  
- The main languages I work in are *Scala*, *C#*, *C++*, *C*, *Python*, (and *Java* but please don't ask me to do anything in that). 
- I am also capable of getting things done in *JS*, *Kotlin*, *Rust*.  
- For Parallel High Performance stuff, I can work with *CUDA*, *OpenMP*, *AVX vector intrinsics*, and *MPI*. 
  
#### For Hardware  
- I mostly work with *Chisel*, and *VHDL*.  
- I also have some experience with *SystemVerilog*, and *Verilog*, as well as *HLS*.  
    
#### For Video-Games  
- My favorite engine is *Godot*.  
- I have also worked with *Unity*, *Phaser*, and bare-bones OpenGL.

## Current Projects I'm Working on  
Here is a list of the different projects that I'm currently actively working on.  

#### ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) [[ Automated Testing ]] Expanding the reach of Grammar-based Exhaustive Testing  
In this project, we are attempting to verify JSON validators using a form of mutation-assisted differential testing. This is based off of a randomized AST generator, which, given an ANTLR grammar, will generate a random valid AST of a certain depth. We then use these random inputs and compare the validator results obtained from python's json tool and jsonlint. We then reduce the inputs using `creduce` and check the validation results against the original ones.  
  
#### ![Scala](https://img.shields.io/badge/scala-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=scala&logoColor=red) ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=red) [[ Compilers ]] Implementing L3, a Lisp-like-language  
In this project, we implement a modern compiler, in Scala, for the L3 language, as well as a runtime in the form of a Virtual Machine being written in Rust.  
  
#### ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/c%23-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white) [[ Video Games ]] Hammered  
Hammered is a 3D puzzle-adventure game based around the usage of a magic flying hammer to solve obstacle-based puzzles. This is currently being implemented using the MonoGame framework in C#.  
  
#### ![Scala](https://img.shields.io/badge/scala-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=scala&logoColor=red) [[ Hardware Verification ]] Chiselverify  
A dynamic verification framework for Chisel. We are currently working on improving the verification tools for approximate designs.
