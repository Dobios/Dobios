- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @Dobios
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in contemporary compiler designs as well as formal verification systems, really anything related to automated testing for both hardware and software, and also video-game developement.  
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about modern hardware compiler infrastructure (more specifically [CIRCT](https://github.com/llvm/circt)).
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm happy to collaborate on any free and open-source video game project :).
- üì´ You can reach me via email (adobis@inf.ethz.ch) or on linked-in.  
- ‚ú® You can find the external repositories to which I am a major/main contributor pinned in my profile ;).  
**********************************
#### For Software  
- The main languages I work in are *Scala*, *C#*, *C++*, *C*, *Python*, (and *Java* but please don't ask me to do anything in that). 
- I am also capable of getting things done in *JS*, *Kotlin*, *Rust*.  
- For Parallel High Performance stuff, I can work with *CUDA*, *OpenMP*, *AVX vector intrinsics*, and *MPI*. 
  
#### For Hardware  
- I mostly work with *Chisel*, and *VHDL*.  
- I also have some experience with *SystemVerilog*, and *Verilog*, as well as *HLS*.  
    
#### For Video-Games  
- My favorite engine is *Godot*.  
- I have also worked with *MonoGame*, *Unity*, *Phaser*, and bare-bones OpenGL.

## Current Projects I'm Working on  
Here is a list of the different projects that I'm currently actively working on.  

#### Formal Verification of Hardware in the CIRCT Compiler 
  - Field: __Hardware Verification / Hardware Compilers__
  - Language: __C++ / MLIR / LLVM / FIRRTL / BTOR2 / SMTLib / SystemVerilog__
  - Description: Augmenting the CIRCT compiler framework to enable the use of formal verification constructs in higher level hardware construction languages.

#### SURE Sustainable Development Energy Tycoon  
  - Field: __Video Games__
  - Language: __C#__
  - Description: Game about managing the impacts of political policies and energy managment choices on the swiss energy grid and society.
